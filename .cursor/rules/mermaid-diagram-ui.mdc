# Mermaid Diagram - UI Components

You are an experienced software architect tasked with creating a Mermaid diagram to visualise the architecture of Astro pages and React components for the login and registration module. The diagram should be created in the following file: DESTINATION

You will need to refer to the following files to learn about the existing components:

<file_references>
[project-prd.md](mdc:.ai/project-prd.md)
</file_references>

<destination>
.ai/diagrams/ui.md
</destination>

Your task is to analyse the specifications of the login and registration module and create a comprehensive Mermaid diagram that accurately represents the system architecture.

Before creating the diagram, analyse the requirements and plan your approach. Place your analysis inside the <architecture_analysis> tags. In this analysis:

1. List all components mentioned in the reference files.
2. Identify the main pages and their corresponding components.
3. Specify the data flow between components.
4. Provide a brief description of each component's functionality.

When you are ready to create the diagram, follow these guidelines:

1. Start the diagram with the following syntax:

   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
   ```
   
2. Include the following elements in your diagram:

   - Updated UI structure after implementing new requirements
   - Layouts, server pages, and updates to existing components
   - Grouping elements by functionality
   - Direction of data flow between components
   - Modules responsible for application state
   - Division into shared components and page-specific components
   - Dependencies between authentication-related components and the rest of the application
   - Highlight components that needed to be updated due to new requirements

3. Follow these Mermaid syntax rules:

   - Use consistent node ID formatting:
     ```
     A[Main Panel] --> B[Login Form]
     B --> C[Data Validation]
     ```
   - Remember that node IDs are case-sensitive and must be unique
   - Use the correct node shapes:
     - `[Text]` for rectangles
     - `(Text)` for rounded rectangles
     - `((Text))` for circles
     - `{Text}` for diamonds
     - `>Text]` for flags
     - `[[Text]]` for subroutines
     
   - Group related elements using subgraphs:
     ```
     subgraph ‘Authentication Module’
       A[Login Form]
       B[Data Validation]
       C[Session Management]
     end
     ```
   - Use intermediate nodes for complex relationships instead of complicated connections
   - Prefer vertical layout for hierarchies and horizontal layout for process flow
   - Use correct connection types:
     - `-->` for standard arrows
     - `---` for lines without arrows
     - `-.->` for dotted lines with arrows
     - `==>` for thick lines with arrows
     - `--Text-->` for arrows with labels
   - Avoid using URLs, endpoint addresses, brackets, long function names, or complex expressions in node names
   - Use consistent naming throughout the document
   - Avoid long labels that may cause rendering issues
   - Use quotation marks for text containing spaces:
     ```
     A[‘Authentication Component’] --> B[‘State Management’]
     ```
   - For node styling, use the correct syntax:
     ```
     A:::styleClass --> B
     ```
     with the class definition:
     ```
     classDef styleClass fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
     ```

4. Avoid these common mistakes:
   - Failure to declare the Mermaid section and diagram type at the beginning
   - Incorrect node IDs (containing unauthorised characters)
   - Unclosed subgraphs (missing ‘end’ for a started ‘subgraph’)
   - Unclosed square brackets in node descriptions
   - Inconsistent flow directions (mixing TD and LR without justification)
   - Overly complex diagrams without proper grouping
   - Overlapping labels and connections

After creating your diagram, review it carefully to ensure there are no syntax errors or rendering issues. Make any necessary corrections to improve clarity and accuracy.

When you are ready to present your final diagram, use <mermaid_diagram> tags to wrap it.
